        <hr>
        <p>When Steph was a little girl, her dad got a job teaching college in Pennsylvania, so the family lived there during the school year and in Tacoma, Washingon during the summer.  The family enjoyed this arrangement because it allowed them to experience different parts of the country.</p>  
        <p>As a child, Steph enjoyed playing outside with her friends; she particularly liked riding her bike, hiking, making crafts, and swimming.</p>  
        <p>Steph always felt that the Pacific Northwest was her home; after graduate school, she moved to Gig Harbor.</p>
